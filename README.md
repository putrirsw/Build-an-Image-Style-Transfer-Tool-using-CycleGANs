Artists like Claude Monet are recognized for the unique styles of their works, such as the unique colour scheme and brush strokes. These are hard to be imitated by normal people, and even for professional painters, it will not be easy to produce a painting whose style is Monet-esque. However, thanks to the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their many variations, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can build and train deep learning models to bring an artist's peculiar style to your photos.

In this project, you will be guided through building a style transfer tool using CycleGAN to "translate" the photos in your album into paintings that are Monet-esque!

Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are a type of deep-learning generative model. A vanilla GAN's architecture involves two networks: a Generator network for generating new examples and a Discriminator network for classifying examples as real (drawn from the training data) or fake (drawn from the Generator). 

GANs typically work with images.  Depending on how we set the objective function of a GAN, the Generator can be used to generate new images that satisfy certain rules. In this guided project, we will be learning about CycleGANs, a class of GANs that can be used for transferring the style of images of one domain onto images in another domain by enforcing Cycle Consistency Loss. For instance, a CycleGAN can "translate" the photo of a landscape into a Monet-esque painting of that landscape.

## After completing this guided project you will be able to:
1. Describe the novelties of CycleGANs compared to traditional GANs.
2. Understand the Cycle Consistency Loss and how it's implemented on images.
3. Build the CycleGAN architecture in Keras.
4. Gain good practices in training deep learning models.
5. Implement a pre-trained CycleGAN for image style transfer tasks.
